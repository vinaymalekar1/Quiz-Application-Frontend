# Quiz Application Frontend

This repository contains the frontend implementation of a **Quiz Application** developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

The frontend provides an interactive user interface for users to:
- Log in
- Attempt quizzes
- View results

It communicates with the backend via **REST APIs**.

## How the Frontend Works

- Built using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Uses **JavaScript Fetch API** to communicate with the backend.
- Displays quizzes, questions, timer, and results dynamically.
- Handles user interactions such as quiz navigation and submission.

## How to Run Frontend on Local Machine

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project folder.
3. Open `register.html` in a web browser  
   **OR**
4. Open the folder in **VS Code** and use **Live Server**.

Ensure backend is running on:  
 **http://localhost:8080**


## Frontend and Backend Connection

- Backend responds with **JSON data** used to render the UI.
- API base URL is configured inside JavaScript files.
